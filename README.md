### Sources

The only runtime dependency is [liblxqt](https://github.com/lxde/liblxqt).   
CMake is needed to build as well as optionally Git to pull latest VCS checkouts. The localization files were outsourced to repository [lxqt-l10n](https://github.com/lxde/lxqt-l10n) so the corresponding dependencies are needed, too. Please refer to this repository's `README.md` for further information.   

Code configuration is handled by CMake. CMake variable `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` will normally have to be set to `/usr`.

To build run `make`, to install `make install` which accepts variable `DESTDIR` as usual.   

### Binary packages

The library is provided by all major Linux distributions like Arch Linux, Debian, Fedora and openSUSE. Just use your package manager to search for string `lxqt-about`.
